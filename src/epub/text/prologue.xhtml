				<p>By <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Welsted.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-12" id="noteref-12" epub:type="noteref">12</a></p>

				<span>To win your hearts and to secure your praise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The comic writers strive by various ways;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By subtle stratagems they act their game,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And leave untried no avenue to fame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One writes the spouse a beating from his wife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And says each stroke was copied from the life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some fix all wit and humour in grimace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And make a livelihood of Pinkey’s<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-13" id="noteref-13" epub:type="noteref">13</a> face.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here, one gay show and costly habits tries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Confiding to the judgment of your eyes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Another smuts his scene (a cunning shaver),</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sure of the rakes’ and of the wenches’ favour.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oft have these arts prevailed, and one may guess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If practised o’er again, would find success.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the bold sage⁠—the poet of tonight⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By new and desperate rules resolved to write;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fain would he give more just applauses rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And please by wit that scorns the aids of vice;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The praise he seeks from worthier motives springs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such praise as praise to those that give it brings.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Your aid most humbly sought, then, Britons lend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And liberal mirth like liberal men defend.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No more let ribaldry, with licence writ,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Usurp the name of eloquence or wit;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No more let lawless farce uncensured go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lewd dull gleanings of a Smithfield show.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-14" id="noteref-14" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis yours with breeding to refine the age,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To chasten wit, and moralise the stage.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ye modest, wise and good, ye fair, ye brave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tonight the champion of your virtues save;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Redeem from long contempt the comic name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And judge politely for your country’s fame.</span>
