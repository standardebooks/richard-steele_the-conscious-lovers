				<h2 epub:type="title">Epilogue</h2>
				<p>By <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Welsted.</p>
				<p>Intended to be spoken by <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Indiana</b>.</p>

				<span>Our author, whom entreaties cannot move,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spite of the dear coquetry that you love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swears he’ll not frustrate (so he plainly means)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By a loose Epilogue, his decent scenes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is it not, sirs, hard fate I meet today,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To keep me rigid still beyond the play?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet I’m saved a world of pains that way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I now can look, I now can move at ease,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor need I torture these poor limbs to please;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor with the hand or foot attempt surprise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor wrest my features, nor fatigue my eyes:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bless me! what freakish gambols have I played!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What motions tried, and wanton looks betrayed!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out of pure kindness all! to overrule</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The threatened hiss, and screen some scribbling fool.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With more respect I’m entertained tonight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our author thinks I can with ease delight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My artless looks while modest graces arm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He says, I need but to appear, and charm.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A wife so formed, by these examples bred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pours joy and gladness round the marriage bed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soft source of comfort, kind relief from care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ’tis her least perfection to be fair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The nymph with Indiana’s worth who vies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A nation will behold with Bevil’s eyes.</span>
